    "- Step 1: There is a .zip file called unzip_me_for_instructions.zip. Use the shutil library to unzip this file.\n",
    "- Step 2: After unzipping the file from step 1, open and read the “instructions.txt file”.\n",
    "- Step 3: After reading the instructions, you should realize you are looking for a phone number, so use regex to figure out a pattern that will find a phone number in a string.\n",
    "- Step 4: In order to apply this regex to multiple text files , create a function that takes in a file and your regex pattern, opens the file, searches for your pattern, and returns back any match.\n",
    "- Step 5: Use the os module to walk through all the folders and files and apply your function to each file.\n",
    "- Step 6: After running through the files, you should have gotten the phone number result 719-266-2837. Keep in mind, we put some random numbers not correctly formatted in some of the .txt files, to make sure your regex expression was looking for the correct formatting.\n",
